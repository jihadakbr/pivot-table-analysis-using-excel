## Objective

My objective is to utilize pivot tables as a recently appointed Junior Data Analyst in a local government office to sort and analyze fleet inventory data, which has already undergone importing and cleaning. The ultimate goal is to prepare the data for visualization in a dashboard and subsequently include the findings in a data report.
